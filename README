Rewrite of delta[1] which is based on the ddmin algorithm described in
[2], extended to put asynchronous IO to use.

The original delta algorithm considers first subsets and then their
complements. Both this implementation and the one from [1] skip the
subset step.

On top of a very recent ASDF and UIOP (namely 3.2 or better), there
are currently four external dependencies,

  https://github.com/tpapp/let-plus
  https://github.com/keithj/getopt

and for tests additionally

  https://common-lisp.net/project/fiveam/

all of which can be installed, e.g., through quicklisp[3].

For a quick overview over the process that will allow you to try out
delta-lisp, please see

  https://github.com/pipping/delta-lisp/wiki/How-to-install-and-run

Each testcase should consist of an input file and a test script that
returns either 0 (to signal success) or anything else (to signal
failure).
