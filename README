Rewrite of delta[1] which is based on the ddmin algorithm described in [2].

The original delta algorithm considers first subsets and then their
complements. Both this implementation and the one from [1] skip the
subset step.

There are two implementations, one in common lisp and one in C++.

The C++ version should work with any C++98 compiler but has only been
tested with g++ and clang++.
The Common Lisp version should work with any common lisp compiler but
has only been tested with sbcl.

The C++ version has no external dependencies.
The Common Lisp version uses

 * osicat: http://common-lisp.net/project/osicat/
 * external-program: http://common-lisp.net/project/osicat/

Both libraries are available via quicklisp[3].

A sample makefile is provided that allows to switch back and forth
between multiple implementations of delta for testing purposes, namely
the two implementations described herein and the one from [1].

In particular, with a shell inside a clone of this repository, as well
as sbcl and quicklisp installed, one can run

  make run-delta-ql

to compile the delta-lisp tool and use it to reduce the file ./input
under the constraint that ./test.sh returns zero. The C++ version is
compiled and run using

  make run-delta-c++

Where delta-lisp and delta-c++ take their input and predicate from can
be set on the command line or through the makefile variables INPUT and
SCRIPT.

The makefile is convenient for testing but by no means necessary in
order to use delta-lisp/c++. Each test consists of an input file named
input and a script named test.sh and resides in a separate
subdirectory.

Please note that tests that rely on bugs in clang and gcc will break
if a version is used that does not exhibit the expected behaviour for
whatever reason (e.g. because the bug has been fixed).

The C++ version uses less memory and is a bit faster, maybe because
the data structures that are used in the Common Lisp implementation
are suboptimal (they certainly are, but that might not be the reason)
whereas std::vector is perfect for the task. Patches are welcome.
