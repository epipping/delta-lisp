Rewrite of delta[1] which is based on the ddmin algorithm described in
[2], extended to put asynchronous IO to use.

The original delta algorithm considers first subsets and then their
complements. Both this implementation and the one from [1] skip the
subset step.

Any common lisp compiler should do but only sbcl has been
tested. There are currently four external dependencies,

  https://common-lisp.net/project/external-program/
  https://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/
  https://github.com/tpapp/let-plus
  https://github.com/keithj/getopt

which can be installed, e.g., through quicklisp[3]. UIOP is also used;
since it is shipped alongside ASDF-3, it is not considered a real
dependency, however.

A sample makefile is provided that allows for easy back-and-forth
switching between multiple implementations of delta, namely the common
lisp implementation described herein and the one from [1] (in
perl). It assumes quicklisp to be installed in ~/quicklisp.

With a shell inside a clone of this repository, as well as sbcl and
quicklisp installed, one can run

  make run-delta-lisp-standalone

to compile the delta-lisp tool and use it to reduce the file ./input
under the constraint that ./test.sh returns zero. Where delta takes
its input and predicate from can be set on the command line or through
the makefile variables INPUT and SCRIPT as in

  make run-delta-lisp-standalone \
    INPUT=test-silly/input \
    SCRIPT=test-silly/test.sh \
    FLAGS='--processes=4'

The makefile is convenient for testing but by no means necessary in
order to use delta-lisp (and thus neither is quicklisp).

Each test consists of an input file and a test script that returns
either 0 (to signal success) or anything else (to signal failure).
